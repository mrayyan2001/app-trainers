   \*\*\* Relationships between classes

   - Aggregation (Has-A) e.g., a car has an engine
   - Composition (Part-Of) e.g., topics are part of a course
   - Association (Uses-A) e.g., a student uses a library
   - Inheritance (Is-A) e.g., a car is a vehicle

9. Error Handling
   - Exception Handling
   - New Exceptions
10. Debugging and breakpoints
    - Syntax Errors (e.g., missing colon, missing parenthesis)
    - Logical Errors (e.g., incorrect algorithm)
    - Runtime Errors (e.g., division by zero)
11. IDEs and Coding Environments
    1. Visual Studio Code
    2. PyCharm
12. File Handling
    - Reading from and writing to files
    - Manipulating file objects
    - Working with different file formats (e.g., text files, CSV files, JSON files)
13. Unit test
