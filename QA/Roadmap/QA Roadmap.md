# QA Roadmap

## Fundamentals

- What is Quality Assurance?
- QA mindset.

### Testing Approaches

1.  Black-box testing.
2.  White-box testing.
3.  Grey-box testing.

### Testing Types

#### Functional testing.

1. UAT
2. Exploratory testing
3. Sanity testing
4. Regression testing
5. Smoke testing
6. Unit testing
7. Integration testing

#### Non-functional testing.

1. Load testing
2. Performance testing
3. Security testing
4. Stress testing

### Manage Your Testing

1. qTest
2. TestRail
3. TestLink
4. Zephyr

### Project Management

1. Atlassian Jira
2. Trello

## SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

1. Waterfall (Hand-off approach)
2. Agile (Sync, iterative approach)
3. Sequential (V-model)

### Agile Methodologies

1. Scrum
2. Kanban
3. XP
4. SAFe

## Manual Testing

1. TDD \
   The team needs to adopt TDD - Developing against testing and use-cases. With this approach, you can assure the minimum amount of time and effort being consumed during regression rounds. Having a clear set of acceptance criteria can make the team more productive in a shorter time
2. Test Planning \
   How we are trying to test, what is the scope of the delivery, and the followed strategy. How we are going to do this
3. Test cases & scenarios \
   Test cases and scenarios creation is the base of all software testing activities - based on clearly written and documented test cases you can cover all the possibilities and release with more confidence
4. Reporting \
   Communicating the QA and testing team outputs can be interpreted in too many different ways, having a solid reporting stream is very essential for all the decisions that a stakeholders/manager can take.
5. Compatibility \
   A QA Engineer is a simulation for many users - you should be able to simulate different users behaviors, capabilities whether its hardware or software components
6. Verification & Validation \
   Understand the difference in between and when to apply **Verification:** Are we building the product in the right way? **Validation:** Are we building the right product?
