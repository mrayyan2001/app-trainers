# Advanced Tools

## Automated Testing

Jest and Vitest are testing frameworks for JavaScript applications that enable
developers to write tests for their code. They help ensure code reliability and
correctness by automating the testing process, identifying bugs, and verifying
functionality.

- Basics: setting up, writing test cases
- Matchers: common matchers (toBe, toEqual, toContain, toBeTruthy, toBeFalsy, toBeNull, toBeUndefined, toBeDefined, toMatch, toMatchObject, toHaveProperty, toHaveLength)
- Mocks: mocking functions, modules, timers
- Testing Asynchronous Code: async/await, promises
- Code Coverage: collecting and reporting coverage
- Testing React Components with React Testing Library: queries (get, query, find), matchers (toBeChecked, toBeDisabled, toBeInTheDocument, toHaveAttribute, toHaveTextContent), firing events with user-event
- Mocking APIs with Mock Service Worker MSW

## Next.js

Next.js is a meta framework built on top of React, enhancing its capabilities with
features like server-side rendering SSR and static site generation SSG. It
simplifies building and optimizing modern web applications with improved
performance and SEO.

- Basics: client and server components, client and server rendering, static and dynamic rendering, static generation SSG
- Styling: global styles, CSS modules, Tailwind
- Routing: pages, layouts, dynamic routes, linking and navigation, error handling, loading UI and streaming
- Data Fetching: fetch API, caching
- Building APIs: route handlers
- Database Integration: Prisma
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- Optimizations: image optimization, lazy loading, automatic code splitting

## React Native

React Native is a framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using
React. It allows developers to write code once and deploy it to both iOS and
Android platforms, leveraging native components for a seamless user experience.

- Basics: View, Text, Image, Touchables, Button, Alert, platform-specific code
- Layouts: dimensions, detecting orientation, Flexbox, absolute and relative
- Styling: StyleSheet, borders, shadows, padding, styling text, icons, platformspecific styles
- Input Components: TextInput, Switch, Picker, custom pickers
- Navigation: React Navigation, stack navigator, tab navigator, drawer navigator
- Native Modules: linking native code, using third-party libraries
- Offline Support: detecting network status, caching, AsyncStorage
- Authentication: auth providers
- Notifications: push notification services
- Distribution: optimizing assets, building, error reporting, environment management
